Personalized Structural Biology approach for rare coding variant interpretation, based on protein structural context and MD simulations.
To explore the molecular basis for the functional changes caused by V469L and V471L, MD simulations of V469L and V471L channel variants and of WT Kv3.2 in POPC membranes was performed. 
Each system was simulated for more than 1Î¼s in total. Figure 4A-C displays simulation snapshots of the three ion channel systems and Videos V1-V6 show representative MD trajectories.
